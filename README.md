# A Dating and Friendship App for Programmers

## API Overview

Our JSON data was generated using [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com/) and stored in a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database. The team used Mongoose to define the shape of our data model (a dating profile) in the form of a Schema. We then used Express with Lodash and Method-override to build and handle our HTTP requests. Testing was done using Chai, Mocha and Supertest.
